# Talking To Myself, AKA My Admission To The Psyche Ward
## Also developer notes or something

This is a set of notes that serve absolutely no purpose other than giving me a future reference to what the hell I was thinking 6 seconds ago. This is not documentation or anything like that. It might not even all be in the same language. 

I'm going to do my best to make this as coherent as possible for 2 reasons:

The first is because the more coherent it is, the easier it is for me to follow and recall my train of thought, which of course leads to less mistakes. It also makes me easier to search for something in case I go "what was my plan for this thing again?"

The second is for archival purposes, sort of. Git doesn't get rid of this stuff. It's entirely possible that one day, this might be needed for something. God help whoever's dealing with this that they have to delve deep into my ramblings because the code and documentation wasn't enough. Or it could just be a curious soul who somehow stumbled upon this text and wants to know as much as possible about the development of this app. Why? I don't know. But what I *do* know is that I absolutely *hate* when something I find interesting isn't preserved. Kind of like Reddit. Actually, *exactly* like Reddit. God, the number of times I tried to go back to something, only for it to have vanished from the entire site. Hopefully, that won't happen to this. Bottom line is: either nobody will read this, and thus not care, or somebody will find this, and be really appreciative. 

... Either way, it's unlikely that these documents will be helpful for anyone other than myself.
